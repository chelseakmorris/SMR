Soil Moisture Routing Model

Objective to program SMR in R.  Current version (simple_grass) is coded as a set of bash/gawk/Perl scripts, relying heavily on GRASS commands.

Water_balance is simple model for a single cell coded in R and based on previous version of the model. In addition to the language change, the ET function was also updated to equation suggested by J. Archibald.
